## Projects

### Project 1: [Facial Keypoint Detection](Projects/Project_1/P1_Facial_Keypoints)

In this project, we have to use image processing techniques and deep learning to recognize faces and facial keypoints, such as the location of the eyes and mouth on a face.

### Project 2: [Image Captioning](Projects/Project_2/P2_Image_Captioning)

In this project, we will have to combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a network that automatically produces captions, given an input image.

### Project 3: [Landmark Detection & Tracking](Projects/Project_3/P3_Landmark_Detection_and_Tracking)

In this project, we will have to use sensor data to localize a robot and build a map of the environment with SLAM.

## Labs

Exercises on Extra Curricular content or topics not covered on the projects
